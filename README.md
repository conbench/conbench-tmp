# Conbench: Language-independent Continuous Benchmarking (CB) Framework

This project provides a developer framework to collect and manage data
generated by language-specific benchmark or performance testing frameworks. By
collecting performance data commit by commit as a project evolves, developers
can monitor performance regressions or improvements on different hardware
configurations, compilers, and operating systems.

## Project Status

This project is in specification / requirements gathering stage and not yet
ready for use. See [doc/REQUIREMENTS.md][1] for more.
