# Conbench: Language-independent Continuous Benchmarking (CB) Framework

This project provides a developer framework to collect and manage data
generated by language-specific benchmark or performance testing frameworks. By
collecting performance data commit by commit as a project evolves, developers
can monitor performance regressions or improvements on different hardware
configurations, compilers, and operating systems.
